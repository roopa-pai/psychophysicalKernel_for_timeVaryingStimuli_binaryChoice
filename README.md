# Finding a  Smoothed Psychophysical Kernel for Time-Varying Stimuli Resulting in Binary Choice

The aim of this experiment was to find how subjects weighted stimuli over time and over varying signal strengths in a forced-choice binocular disparity task with a simultaneously displayed “cued” stimulus, which was relevant, and an “uncued” stimulus, intended to be ignored.
